#Data Analysis

“treatment” (which is the column related to the following question: Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?  ) was defined as the target variable for prediction and structured the analysis in several parts:
  
- General demographics: Understand the basic profile of individuals.
             
- Factors influencing treatment-seeking: Analyze personal and workplace-related variables associated with treatment uptake.

- Employer support analysis: Evaluate how mental health support is offered and perceived within companies.

- Mental vs. physical health: Compare how seriously mental health concerns are taken relatively  to physical health.
             
This process was conducted both on the global dataset and focused specifically on Tunisia, providing localized insights relevant to the country of residence.
             
For the **predictive modeling phase**, multiple classification algorithms were experimented and, based on evaluation metrics, the Random Forest classifier was selected as the best-performing model to predict who might need mental health treatment. After training the model, the top features influencing the prediction were extracted, which informed the development of practical recommendations.
